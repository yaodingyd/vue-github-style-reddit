# Github style Reddit

> Vue, Vuex and Vue-router

Based on [https://github.com/Ikuu/vue-reddit](https://github.com/Ikuu/vue-reddit) and converted to Vuex application.

Vuex adds complexity to original implementation. URL-based render is far more suitable to Reddit's API.

### Inspiration

Want to check reddit post in work but looks like to your coworker you are checking Github issues.
